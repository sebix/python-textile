TODO

* Improve documentation, both of the code and Textile syntax.
** Not all functions have docstrings or adequate docstrings.
** Because the Textile syntax implemented by PyTextile has deviated from the syntax implemented by other implementations of Textile, PyTextile-specific documentation needs to be produced for end-users.
* Add Textile 2.4 functionality
** Footnotes:
*** [\d\+] doesn't work after punctutation
*** Add new backlink functionality
*** Add [\d\+!] functionality to disable adding the link.  Although, what exactly is the point of this?
